Title:
Refactoring - Create Organization with Default Team

Type:
Refactor / Enhancement

Description:
This task involves refactoring the existing Create Organization functionality to ensure that a default team is automatically created whenever a new organization is added to the system.

Objective:

Simplify onboarding by ensuring every organization has at least one team by default.

Improve data consistency and avoid edge cases where an organization exists without a team.


Scope of Work:

Modify the organization creation flow to include the creation of a default team (e.g., “Default Team” or configurable name).

Ensure transactional consistency: if default team creation fails, the organization creation should be rolled back.

Add appropriate unit and integration tests.

Update API documentation if applicable.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] Organization creation API returns success only if default team is also created.

[ ] Default team appears under the newly created organization in the system.

[ ] Unit tests for successful and failed team creation scenarios are added.

[ ] Code follows project-level coding standards and passes code review.


Impact Area:

Organization Service / Team Service

Database schema (if any changes are required)


Assignee:
[Assign as needed]

Priority:
[Set as per team standards – e.g., Medium/High]

This update is related to creating secrets using our TCT tool.
Currently, we have the flexibility to update the region configuration, and based on the selected region, the tool will create the secret in that region.

This change will not impact the existing secrets unless a new region is explicitly provided.
For local development, the application can use this variable to run properly.

In the existing ECS service, the DevOps team can configure and update this variable value as needed for the application.
