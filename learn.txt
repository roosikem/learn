We are receiving the same conversation ID for different users because the plugin is receiving the same ContactId for each user session. When the plugin sends a request to GPT, it includes this ContactId as the value of form.identifier. Since the identifier remains the same, the GPT service returns the same conversation ID, causing the responses to overlap across different users.

🎫 Title:

Investigate and identify reason for setting new code baseline as 3.2.0 in SonarQube portal


---

Description:

We need to analyze and document the reasoning behind setting 3.2.0 as the new code baseline in SonarQube. This will ensure that the decision to update the baseline is justified, aligns with release milestones, and supports accurate code quality tracking.


---

Objective:

🔹 Identify why version 3.2.0 is appropriate as the new baseline rather than continuing with 2.9.3.
🔹 Confirm the business, technical, or release-related reasons that warrant this change.
🔹 Provide supporting evidence (e.g., release notes, stability reports, team consensus).


---

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ Documented reason for choosing 3.2.0 as the new baseline (e.g., major release, stable code, clean state).
✅ Validation that 3.2.0 represents a significant, clean, or stable release suitable for baseline.
✅ Impact assessment on how this change will affect code quality tracking and Quality

🎫 Title:

SonarQube portal - missing past analysis data


---

Description:

We have identified that historical data for past code analyses is missing in the SonarQube portal. The portal is only displaying data from recent analyses, and prior records (e.g., trends, issues history) are not visible in project dashboards or charts.


---

Impact:

Inability to view historical trends (code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities over time).

Loss of visibility into improvements or regressions across previous builds.

Hinders audit, compliance, and reporting efforts related to code quality.



---

Steps to Reproduce:

1️⃣ Login to the SonarQube portal.
2️⃣ Navigate to any project that has previously had multiple analyses.
3️⃣ Check the trends and history sections on the project dashboard.
4️⃣ Observe that older analysis data is missing or incomplete.


---

Expected Result:

All historical code analysis data should be visible and accessible for projects.


---

Actual Result:

Only recent analysis data is shown; older data is missing from dashboards and reports.


---

Environment:

SonarQube version: <fill in>

Deployment: <fill in - e.g., on-prem / AWS / GCP>

Last known good date (when historical data was visible): <fill in>



---

Priority:

⚡ High — Affects quality tracking, reporting, and historical analysis.


---

Next Steps (for assignee):

✅ Check SonarQube DB integrity and data retention policies.
✅ Review cleanup settings (e.g., sonar.dbcleaner.cleanDirectory, sonar.dbcleaner.daysBeforeDeletingInactiveBranches).
✅ Analyze SonarQube logs for cleanup or DB-related errors.
✅ Propose remediation steps (e.g., DB restore, reconfiguration).

📌 Title

Add new API for generating dynamic host URL for Test Tool simulation


---

📌 Description

Developed a new API in the Test Tool that dynamically generates the host URL for simulation purposes.

Key features:
✅ API accepts an environment parameter in the request (e.g., dev, qa, prod).
✅ Host URL is generated dynamically based on this environment.
✅ The URL is resolved from environment variables (e.g., HOST_URL_DEV, HOST_URL_QA, HOST_URL_PROD).
✅ Graceful handling of missing or invalid environment mappings (error or default URL).
✅ Logs the selected environment and resolved URL safely for traceability.


---

📌 Use Case

The Test Tool simulates calling external services (e.g., Message API).

Before calling the service, it dynamically generates the host URL based on the provided environment.

Supports flexible testing across multiple environments without code changes.



---

📌 Acceptance Criteria

✅ API returns the correct host URL based on provided environment param.
✅ Supports at least dev, qa, prod environments.
✅ Returns meaningful error if environment variable is missing or environment is unsupported.
✅ Does not log sensitive information (no hardcoded secrets in logs).
✅ Provides clear log output for resolved environment and URL.


---

📌 Impact

Enables dynamic URL generation for simulation of external API calls.

Reduces hardcoding and improves flexibility for testing multiple environments.

Simplifies maintenance and environment configuration.



---

📌 Code components modified

New controller method added for Test Tool host URL generation API.

New utility/service method for environment-to-host resolution.

Added logging for resolved environment and URL.



---

📌 Test scenarios

✅ Request with env=dev → returns URL from HOST_URL_DEV.

✅ Request with env=qa → returns URL from HOST_URL_QA.

✅ Request with env=prod → returns URL from HOST_URL_PROD.

✅ Request with invalid env → returns error or default URL.

✅ Request with missing env variable → handled gracefully.

📌 Title

Add test-tool/auth API for generating Cognito token for UI Test Tool simulation


---

📌 Description

Implemented a new API at test-tool/auth to generate a Cognito token for UI Test Tool functionality.

Purpose:

Allow UI Test Tool to simulate Bridge Message API calls by first obtaining a valid Cognito token.

This token is for UI simulation only — it is not an app or system token.


Key features:
✅ REST endpoint created under test-tool/auth.
✅ Uses provided credentials (via basic auth) to generate token from Cognito.
✅ Token is cached in memory per URL until expiry (based on expires_in field).
✅ Automatically refreshes token when expired.
✅ Protects sensitive data (e.g. credentials) in logs via masking.


---

📌 Use Case

The UI Test Tool simulates Bridge Message API calls.

Before making the Bridge Message API call, it calls test-tool/auth to get a valid Cognito token.

This token is attached to subsequent simulation API calls.



---

📌 Acceptance Criteria

✅ test-tool/auth API returns a valid Cognito token for UI testing.
✅ Token is cached in memory per URL until expiry.
✅ Token refreshes automatically when expired.
✅ No sensitive data appears in logs (e.g., password, token).
✅ Proper error handling and meaningful log messages on failure.


---

📌 Impact

Enables UI testing of Bridge Message API simulations with valid tokens.

Reduces load on Cognito through in-memory token reuse.

Prevents accidental exposure of secrets in logs.



---

📌 Code components modified

Added UiTestTokenService (or similar) for token handling.

Added REST controller for test-tool/auth API.

Enhanced logging for security.



---

📌 Test scenarios

✅ Successfully generate token with valid credentials.

✅ Return cached token until expiry.

✅ Refresh token after expiry and return new token.

✅ Handle invalid credentials gracefully.

✅ Log sensitive info safely (masked).



---

👉 If you'd like, I can provide this in Jira markup format or generate Swagger API doc entry for the new API! Let me know 🚀.

Title:
[Plugin v2.9.3] User Message Response Not Received When Welcome Message is Present in Apple Business Chat

Type:
Bug

Priority:
High


---

Description:
In plugin version 2.9.3, when a welcome message is present in the system, the plugin returns only the welcome message upon receiving a user message via Apple Business Chat, but does not return a response for the user's message.

This issue occurs during the first interaction and results in a missing response for the message sent by the user. However, this behavior works correctly in earlier versions like plugin v3.1.0, where both the welcome message and user message response are returned.


---

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the Apple Business Chat window.


2. Ensure that a welcome message is configured in the system.


3. Send a message like: "test feature simple message"


4. Observe that:

The welcome message is received.

The response to the user message is NOT received.





---

Expected Behavior:

If a welcome message exists, the system should return both:

1. The configured welcome message


2. The response for the user’s message (e.g., "This is a simple message")



If no welcome message exists, the system should return only the user message response — which is already working as expected.



---

Actual Behavior:

When a welcome message is configured:

Only the welcome message is received.

The response for the user’s input message is missing.


When no welcome message is configured:

The response to the user message is correctly received.




---

Impact:

Users receive no reply to their first message when a welcome message is configured.

Leads to a broken or unresponsive experience in live chat scenarios.



---

Action Required:

Investigate and fix the response flow to ensure that the user message response is always sent, regardless of whether a welcome message is present.



---

Environment:

Plugin Version: 2.9.3 (Issue present)

Plugin Version: 3.1.0 (Working correctly)

Channel: Apple Business Chat

Title:
Fix: Verbose text/plain Message Not Sent with Attachment in Plugin Version 3.x.x for Image Recognition

Type:
Bug

Priority:
Medium (Adjust as per impact)

Description:
In the current implementation of the Image Recognition feature plugin (version 3.x.x), the system is sending a verbose text/plain message along with the attachment. This behavior was not present in the previous plugin versions.

Issue Observed:

In plugin version 3.x.x, a text/plain verbose message is being sent in addition to the image attachment.

In earlier versions, this verbose message was not sent, which indicates a regression or unintended behavior change.


Expected Behavior:
The plugin should replicate the behavior of earlier versions by not sending the verbose text/plain message along with the attachment—unless explicitly configured.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Trigger the image recognition feature with a sample image.


2. Observe the outgoing message payload in version 3.x.x.


3. Compare with the behavior in earlier versions.



Impact:

May affect downstream systems or integrations expecting only the image attachment.

Can lead to inconsistencies in message handling.


Suggested Fix:
Review and align the message construction logic in version 3.x.x to match the previous plugin behavior or provide a configurable option to control verbosity.

Environment:
Plugin Version: 3.x.x
Feature: Image Recognition
Message Type: text/plain with attachment

🛠️ Ticket Title:

Add: Enum Validation for Create & Update ConfigurationProperty API

⸻

📝 Description:

Introduce validation logic to ensure that enum fields (e.g., componentType, userType) in the ConfigurationProperty create and update APIs only accept valid enum values defined in the backend.

Invalid or unrecognized values should trigger a user-friendly error with proper HTTP 400 Bad Request response.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Validate enum fields using Enum::name() mapping or a dedicated utility.
	•	Return clear error message listing allowed values if an invalid value is provided.
	•	Apply this check for both create and update flows.
	•	Add test cases to validate correct behavior for valid and invalid enums.

⸻

🔍 Impact:

Prevents invalid or unexpected enum values from being stored, improving data integrity and reducing downstream errors.

🔍 Validation Details Implemented:
	•	Introduced validation for enum fields such as componentType and userType during both create and update operations of ConfigurationProperty.
	•	Validation logic compares incoming values against the full list of supported enum constants using Enum::name().toUpperCase() for case-insensitive matching.
	•	If the value is null or does not match any of the allowed enums:
	•	A ConfigurationPropertyServiceException is thrown.
	•	The exception message clearly lists the accepted values, improving debuggability and user feedback.
	•	Example message returned on invalid input:

Kindly provide the correct componentType. Allowed values: [TYPE_A, TYPE_B, TYPE_C]

	5.	Converters and encryption:
	•	The accountLocked field is encrypted using Spring Data MongoDB’s @ValueConverter with a custom AES-based encryption logic via EncryptedBooleanConverter.
	6.	Security:
	•	Unlock API is protected with ROLE_ADMIN access.
	•	Unlock actions are logged for audit purposes.

⸻

✅ Technical Implementation Summary
	•	Updated User entity to include:
	•	failedLoginAttempts, accountLocked, lockTime
	•	Used @ValueConverter(EncryptedBooleanConverter.class) to store encrypted account lock status.
	•	Added custom converters via PropertyValueConverter<Boolean, String, ValueConversionContext>.
	•	Added lockout logic inside AuthenticationService.authenticate().
	•	Added admin controller with:
	•	PUT /api/admin/unlock/{username}
	•	Optional: Enabled Spring Security role-based access on unlock endpoint.
	•	Optional: Logging unlock actions via SLF4J or to an AuditLog collection.

✅ Feature implemented and verified:
	1.	Account is now locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts.
	2.	Lockout status (accountLocked) is stored in encrypted format using @ValueConverter and a custom EncryptedBooleanConverter.
	3.	User receives proper error message when account is locked: “Your account is locked. Please contact admin to unlock.”
	4.	Admin unlock API added at PUT /api/admin/unlock/{username} — resets lock status, attempts, and timestamp.
	5.	Spring Security role-based protection (ROLE_ADMIN) applied to the unlock endpoint.
	6.	Manual unlock actions are logged for traceability.
	7.	Code reviewed and tested locally and on dev environment.

✅ Ready for QA validation.

Title:
Refactoring - Create Organization with Default Team

Type:
Refactor / Enhancement

Description:
This task involves refactoring the existing Create Organization functionality to ensure that a default team is automatically created whenever a new organization is added to the system.

Objective:

Simplify onboarding by ensuring every organization has at least one team by default.

Improve data consistency and avoid edge cases where an organization exists without a team.


Scope of Work:

Modify the organization creation flow to include the creation of a default team (e.g., “Default Team” or configurable name).

Ensure transactional consistency: if default team creation fails, the organization creation should be rolled back.

Add appropriate unit and integration tests.

Update API documentation if applicable.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] Organization creation API returns success only if default team is also created.

[ ] Default team appears under the newly created organization in the system.

[ ] Unit tests for successful and failed team creation scenarios are added.

[ ] Code follows project-level coding standards and passes code review.


Impact Area:

Organization Service / Team Service

This update is related to creating secrets using our TCT tool.
Currently, we have the flexibility to update the region configuration, and based on the selected region, the tool will create the secret in that region.

This change will not impact the existing secrets unless a new region is explicitly provided.
For local development, the application can use this variable to run properly.

In the existing ECS service, the DevOps team can configure and update this variable value as needed for the application.
