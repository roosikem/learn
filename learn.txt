Title:
Backend - Add User Type to Distinguish Between Local and SSO Users During User Creation

Type:
Feature / Backend Enhancement

Description:
Enhance the backend user creation logic to introduce a userType field that distinguishes between Local and SSO users. Based on this type, apply conditional handling for password generation and sharing.

Objective:

Introduce user type-based behavior during user creation.

Improve handling of password creation and sharing based on user type.


Scope of Work:

Add a userType field (LOCAL or SSO) to the user entity and database schema.

Update user creation logic:

For LOCAL users: Generate a password and return/show it to the user upon successful creation.

For SSO users: Generate and save a password internally, but do not return/share it with the user.


Apply default behavior if userType is not provided (e.g., default to LOCAL).

Ensure sensitive data like passwords are stored securely (hashed).

Update unit and integration tests.

Modify API documentation accordingly.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] userType is saved correctly in the DB as LOCAL or SSO.

[ ] For LOCAL users, password is returned in the API response.

[ ] For SSO users, password is generated and stored, but not shown to the user.

[ ] System behavior is validated with test coverage.

[ ] No breaking changes in existing user management flows.


Impact Area:

User Creation API

User Entity & Repository

Password Generation Utility

DB Schema (if needed)

Would you like to enforce different validations or behavior based on user type as well?



@Component
public class ValidationUtils {

    @Autowired
    private Validator validator;

    public <T> void validate(T object) {
        Set<ConstraintViolation<T>> violations = validator.validate(object);
        if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
            throw new ConstraintViolationException(violations);
        }
    }
}

public class RoleNameValidator implements ConstraintValidator<ValidRoleName, String> {

    private static final Pattern ROLE_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("^[A-Z]+(?:_[A-Z]+)*$");

    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String value, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
        if (value == null || value.isBlank()) return false;
        if (value.startsWith("_") || value.endsWith("_")) return false;
        if (value.contains("__")) return false;
        return ROLE_PATTERN.matcher(value).matches();
    }

Title:
Backend Endpoint to Retrieve Engine Configuration in JSON Format

Type:
Feature / Backend API

Description:
Develop a backend API endpoint to retrieve engine configuration details in a specific JSON format. The response should include key-value pairs, where the key name (e.g., apix_key) is dynamically derived from the configuration properties stored in the engine configuration database.

Objective:

Expose a clean, structured JSON API for engine configuration retrieval.

Dynamically fetch key names from configuration properties stored in the DB.


Expected Response Format:

{
  "apix_key": "some value"
}

Scope of Work:

Create a GET endpoint (e.g., /api/engine/config).

Fetch the required property key name and its corresponding value from the engine configuration table.

Build and return the JSON response using the key name from the DB.

Ensure proper error handling if the key or value is not present.

Secure the endpoint if necessary.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] Endpoint is accessible and returns configuration in the specified JSON format.

[ ] Key name is fetched dynamically from the DB.

[ ] Proper logging and exception handling are in place.

[ ] Unit and integration tests are added.

[ ] API documentation is updated if required.


Impact Area:

Title:
Modify TCT Backend to Use Single DB (Disable Multitenancy via Config)

Type:
Refactor / Configuration Update

Description:
Refactor the TCT backend to use a single database instead of the current multi-tenant setup. If feasible, disable multitenancy through a configuration switch. Retain and comment out the existing multitenancy code for potential future use, as discussed with Shyam.

Objective:

Simplify the backend setup by switching to a single DB mode.

Ensure flexibility to re-enable multitenancy in the future if required.


Scope of Work:

Introduce a configuration flag to control multitenancy enablement.

When multitenancy is disabled, route all operations to the default single database instance.

Comment out multitenancy-related code blocks without deletion for future reference.

Ensure no impact on existing functionality.

Test application behavior with both single DB and multitenancy modes.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] A config property is introduced to enable/disable multitenancy.

[ ] When disabled, the system operates with a single database instance.

[ ] All multitenancy logic is safely commented with clear annotations.

[ ] Application runs without errors in single DB mode.

[ ] Changes verified and confirmed with Shyam.

[ ] All related test cases are updated accordingly.

Title:
Refactoring - Create Organization with Default Team

Type:
Refactor / Enhancement

Description:
This task involves refactoring the existing Create Organization functionality to ensure that a default team is automatically created whenever a new organization is added to the system.

Objective:

Simplify onboarding by ensuring every organization has at least one team by default.

Improve data consistency and avoid edge cases where an organization exists without a team.


Scope of Work:

Modify the organization creation flow to include the creation of a default team (e.g., “Default Team” or configurable name).

Ensure transactional consistency: if default team creation fails, the organization creation should be rolled back.

Add appropriate unit and integration tests.

Update API documentation if applicable.


Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] Organization creation API returns success only if default team is also created.

[ ] Default team appears under the newly created organization in the system.

[ ] Unit tests for successful and failed team creation scenarios are added.

[ ] Code follows project-level coding standards and passes code review.


Impact Area:

Organization Service / Team Service

Database schema (if any changes are required)

Here’s your corrected and professional version of the paragraph:


---

This update is related to creating secrets using our TCT tool.
Currently, we have the flexibility to update the region configuration, and based on the selected region, the tool will create the secret in that region.

This change will not impact the existing secrets unless a new region is explicitly provided.
For local development, the application can use this variable to run properly.

In the existing ECS service, the DevOps team can configure and update this variable value as needed for the application.
